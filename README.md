Title: "GitHub Basics for College Projects"
Introduction: GitHub is a kind of repository which helps people to display and upload their work to help other people and it is also helpful in collaborating with others to make changes in project.

My Goals with GithUB:
1. To explore projects
2. To upload my repos, also side by side collaborating with other people as a team work
